# County Data Exploration
## What can I do with county data

My goal is to become more familiar with mapping data and statistical analysis with different data sets. The interesting part about working with county data is that there is a lot of data that uses counties as the lowest denominator. Unemployment data is all captured at the county level. Federal election results are reported at the county level. A lot of census data is available at the county level also.

My main area of interest is in unemployment data, but it would be facinating to look at a relationship between many of these groups. If I can begin to understand how to map and pull in county data, I am confident I will learn a lot.

### Step 1
The first step is to scrape or pull in county data and add it to a map. The great people at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics have already created a map which can be found [here](https://data.bls.gov/lausmap/showMap.jsp;jsessionid=130728D21177009D119C2F3F57220E2B._t3_07v). I can use this map to check my results.

### Step 2
For the second step I will gather election data. I have chosen the MIT Data Lab and have started with the dataset found [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ),  This data set tracks presidential election results by county (general election, not primaries).  Currently it is only updated through 2016, but hopefully it will be updated for 2020 and we can use it with minimal adjustment.

### Step 3
??? Maybe industry GDP by county?

D3 implimentation?
